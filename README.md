# coronaWar_game
Corona War is a simple game built using Pygame - a python library

This is basically a shooting game, where the player controls the health worker by moving him horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires the vaccine at the descending corona viruses.

Instructions to play:
1. Press the space key(spacebar)  to fire a vaccine to kill the corona virus
2. Press the left and right arrow keys to move the health worker horizontally
3. The player will gain a point only if the vaccine hits the corona virus
4. Everytime when the score increases by five, one more virus gets created. (Initially, there will be only one virus)
5. The game ends if any of the corona viruses hit the health worker
